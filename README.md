# Python-based-CLI-Weather-App
This app gives you Weather Information. It is a CLI Program and developed in Python.
It was just an Exercise for me on Dealing with API data.
I have uploaded it for a simple portfolio, but you may use it if you wanna get Weather Information in your Terminal.

I will aslo make GUI based app that will visualize Weather Data and will give a good Experiance In Sha ALLAH ‚ù§ .
